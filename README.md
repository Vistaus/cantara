Open Source Song Presentation Software

## About the program
Cantara is a simple open source song presentation software written in Free Pascal/Lazarus which allows people to spontanously present song lyrics for a bigger audience for the purpose of singing together. This is especially useful for church groups and meetings. 

## Current Version
The current version is 1.1 released at May 28 2020.

## Song templates
In order to make songs appear in that list, song templates have to be prepared once. A song consists of a txt-File which has the following structure:

Stanza 1 Line 1
Stanza 1 Line 2

Stanza 2 Line 1
Stanza 2 Line 2

Stanzas are seperated by double line wrap. Lines of stanza are seperated by a single line wrap. Repetitions (such as refrains) can be implemented by copy and paste. That's it. The user set ups a directory where all the stanzas will be stored.

## Settings
The color and font size of the presentation can be changed in the settings.

## Licence
The program is licenced under GPL3. See COPYING for details.
