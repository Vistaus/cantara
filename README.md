## About the program
Cantara is a simple open source song presentation software written in Free Pascal/Lazarus which allows people to spontanously present song lyrics for a bigger audience for the purpose of singing together. This is especially useful for church groups and meetings. 

## Current Version
The current version is 2.2 released at July 5, 2022.

## Song templates
In order to make songs appear in that list, song templates have to be prepared once. A song consists of a txt-File which has the following structure:

    Stanza 1 Line 1
    Stanza 1 Line 2
    
    Stanza 2 Line 1
    Stanza 2 Line 2

Stanzas are seperated by double line wrap. Lines of stanza are seperated by a single line wrap. Repetitions (such as refrains) can be implemented by copy and paste. That's it. The user set ups a directory where all the stanzas will be stored.

At the moment an other [GitHub Repository with public domain Christian song lyrics is under construction](https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara_songrepo), which can be directly imported to Cantara.

## Settings
The color and font of the presentation can be changed in the settings.

## Licence
The program is licenced under GPL3. See [COPYING](https://github.com/reckel-jm/cantara/blob/master/COPYING) for details. You may use and change this software and it's source code and share it as you wish, but you need to add a copyright hint and keep the licence.
